# FoundBiome
Most useful when going for the "Adventuring Time" achievement, but could be used for other things.

Announces when a player find a 'new' biome.  It directly uses existing json files for the world, so it won't announce any biomes you've already discovered.

You can list the biomes you've discovered in-game by using /biomes

You can list the name of the current biome you're in by executing /biome
