# FoundBiome
Most useful when going for the "Adventuring Time" achievement, but could be used for other things.

Sends the player a message a 'new' biome is entered.  It directly uses existing json files for the world, so it won't notify about any biomes you've already discovered.

You can list the biomes you've already discovered in-game by using /biomes

You can list the name of the current biome you're in by executing /biome
